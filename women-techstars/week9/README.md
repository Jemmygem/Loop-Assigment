JavaScript Functions: This article explains the concept of functions in JavaScript. It covers topics such as function declaration, function expression, function invocation, function parameters, function return values, and function scope.
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
Function invocation: The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function for example; When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
Function return: When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
A function declaration: using the `function` keyword followed by the function name and the function body. Function declarations are loaded before any code is executed, so they can be called before they are defined.
A function expression: by assigning a function to a variable. Function expressions are not hoisted, so they cannot be called before they are defined.

Control Flow Statements : This article provides an overview of control flow statements in JavaScript. It covers topics such as `if` statements, `else` statements, `switch` statements, `for` loops, `while` loops, and `do-while` loops.
